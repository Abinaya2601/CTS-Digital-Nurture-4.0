  <h1>Bootstrap Folder Structure Explanation</h1>
  <p>
    When you download Bootstrap, the folder contains several important subfolders including <strong>css</strong>, <strong>js</strong>, and <strong>icons</strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. <strong>css folder:</strong><br />
    This folder contains the compiled CSS files that control the appearance of your webpage using Bootstrap styles. It includes files like <code>bootstrap.css</code> (full version) and <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> (minified version for faster loading). You link these files in your HTML to apply Bootstrap's design.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. <strong>js folder:</strong><br />
    This folder contains JavaScript files that make Bootstrap components interactive. For example, it enables dropdown menus, modals, tooltips, and accordions. Files like <code>bootstrap.bundle.min.js</code> include the necessary scripts and dependencies to make these features work. You include these files in your HTML to add dynamic behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. <strong>icons folder:</strong><br />
    This folder contains Bootstrap Icons, a library of scalable vector icons. It includes font files and CSS files that allow you to easily add icons (like social media icons) to your web pages by using icon classes such as <code>&lt;i class="bi bi-facebook"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>.
